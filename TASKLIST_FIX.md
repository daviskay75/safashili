# TASKLIST_FIX - Production Readiness Issues

> **Status**: Generated from comprehensive audit on 2025-01-10  
> **Context**: Sophisticated psychology practice website with extensive dev work completed (DEV A/B/C teams)  
> **Priority**: Production deployment blockers identified - core architecture is solid

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**What's Built**: Professional psychology practice website with:
- ‚úÖ **Complete design system** (30+ UI components, animations, responsive)
- ‚úÖ **Full page architecture** (15+ pages: specialties, cities, modalities)
- ‚úÖ **Advanced API system** (5 endpoints, validation, security, rate limiting)
- ‚úÖ **SEO optimization** (structured data, local SEO, analytics framework)
- ‚úÖ **Performance infrastructure** (Core Web Vitals, bundle optimization)

**What's Missing**: Production deployment configuration:
- üî∂ Email service (currently dev-only console logging)
- üî∂ Database persistence (currently memory storage)
- üî∂ Test implementation (framework ready, no test files)
- üî∂ Professional image asset (placeholder exists)

**Assessment**: High-quality, nearly production-ready website requiring environment setup.

## üö® **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS**

> **Context**: Sophisticated website architecture with extensive DEV A/B/C work completed  
> **Issue**: Production deployment blockers preventing launch of otherwise complete site

### 1. Email System Production Configuration

- [ ] **1.5** Test email delivery in staging environment
- [ ] **1.6** Verify email templates render correctly in real client

### 2. Data Persistence Production Setup
**Status**: MEMORY-ONLY - Contact/booking data lost on server restart (dev-appropriate)
- [ ] **2.1** Choose production database (PostgreSQL recommended for healthcare)
- [ ] **2.2** Create database schema for contacts, bookings, GDPR requests
- [ ] **2.3** Replace Map() storage in `src/lib/contact-management.ts` with DB queries
- [ ] **2.4** Replace Map() storage in `src/lib/booking.ts` with DB persistence
- [ ] **2.5** Implement database migrations and seeding
- [ ] **2.6** Add connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] **2.7** Test data persistence and backup procedures

### 3. Test Suite Implementation

- [ ] **3.5** Write SEO tests for structured data (`tests/seo/`)
- [ ] **3.6** Write accessibility tests (WCAG compliance) (`tests/accessibility/`)
- [ ] **3.7** Write performance tests (Core Web Vitals) (`tests/performance/`)
- [ ] **3.8** Write integration tests for booking flow (`tests/integration/`)
- [ ] **3.9** Write business logic tests for booking/scheduling (`tests/business/`)
- [ ] **3.10** Write security tests for rate limiting/validation (`tests/security/`)
- [ ] **3.11** Verify all 10+ test scripts run successfully

### 4. Professional Image Assets
**Status**: PLACEHOLDER - Hero image affects Core Web Vitals LCP score
- [ ] **4.1** Replace placeholder with professional headshot photo
